# Drug-Price-Prediction

In many countries, the prices of drugs are mostly imposed, even if free prices exist for some of them. The pricing process follows a framework very specific regulations. However, price differences may remain.
The goal of the project is to develop a predictive model to estimate how much a drug costs for example to help set the price and to detect anomalies in the tariffs.
